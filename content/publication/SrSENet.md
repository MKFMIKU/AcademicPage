abstract = "Recent works on single image super-resolution are concentrated on improving performance through enhancing spatial encoding between convolutional layers. In this paper, we focus on modeling the correlations between channels of convolutional features. We present an effective deep residual network based on squeeze-and-excitation blocks (called SEBlock) to reconstruct high-resolution image (HR) from low-resolution image (LR). SEBlock is used to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature mappings. Further, short connections between each SEBlock are used to remedy information loss. We evaluate our proposed method on several popular benchmarks. The experiment results show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance and get finer texture details through the test in some datasets. It outperforms several currently popular methods in most cases with less depth network and in a more flexible way, especially in case of high upscale rate."
